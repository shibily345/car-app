## Architecture

### State Management
- Uses Provider pattern for state management
- Local state for UI interactions
- Consumer pattern for reactive updates

### Code Structure
```

├── search.dart                 # Main search page
├── README.md                   # This documentation
└── widgets/
    └── search_performance_widget.dart  # Performance utilities
```

### Key Components

#### SearchPage
- Main search interface
- Manages filter and sort states
- Handles animations and transitions

#### DebouncedSearchField
- Performance-optimized search input
- Configurable debounce duration
- Custom styling support

#### SearchResultCache
- In-memory caching for search results
- Configurable cache size
- Automatic cache management

#### SearchSuggestions
- Recent search history display
- Quick access to previous searches
- Customizable suggestion count

## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```dart
class SearchPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SearchPage({super.key});

  @override
  SearchPageState createState() => SearchPageState();
}
```

### Filter Usage
```dart
// Price range filtering
RangeValues _priceRange = const RangeValues(0, 1000000);

// Make and model filtering
String? _selectedMake;
String? _selectedModel;

// Apply filters
final filteredCars = _getFilteredAndSortedCars(cars);
```

### Sort Usage
```dart
// Available sort options
final List<String> _sortOptions = [
  'relevance',
  'price_low_high',
  'price_high_low',
  'year_new_old',
  'year_old_new',
  'mileage_low_high',
  'date_new_old'
];
```

## Performance Features

### Debouncing
- 300ms default debounce duration
- Configurable via `debounceDuration` parameter
- Reduces API calls during rapid typing

### Caching
- In-memory cache for search results
- Maximum 100 cached queries
- Automatic cache cleanup

### Animation Performance
- Staggered animations for list items
